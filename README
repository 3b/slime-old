Overview.
----------------------------------------

  SLIME is the Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs. It is
  implemented in two main parts: the Emacs Lisp side (slime.el), and
  the support library for the Common Lisp (swank.lisp and swank-*.lisp)

  For a real description, see the manual in doc/

Quick setup instructions
------------------------

  Add this to your ~/.emacs file and fill in the appropriate filenames:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/hacking/lisp/slime/")  ; your SLIME directory
    (setq inferior-lisp-program "/opt/sbcl/bin/sbcl") ; your Lisp system
    (require 'slime)
    (slime-setup)

  Make sure your `inferior-lisp-program' is set to a compatible
  version of Lisp.

  slime-setup command is used also to load additional contribs, most often used
  meta-contrib is slime-fancy, it include a better REPL, and many more nice features,
  to load it change (slime-setup) form above to (slime-setup '(slime-fancy))
  
  Use `M-x' slime to fire up and connect to an inferior Lisp.
  SLIME will now automatically be available in your Lisp source
  buffers.
