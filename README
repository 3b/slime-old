Overview.
----------------------------------------

  SLIME is the Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs. It is
  implemented in two main parts: the Emacs Lisp side (slime.el), and
  the support library for the Common Lisp (swank.lisp for CMUCL,
  swank-sbcl.lisp, swank-openmcl.lisp for the others)

  For a real description, see the commentary in slime.el.

Quick setup instructions for CMUCL
----------------------------------------

  In Emacs Lisp:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "/the/path/to/this/directory")
    (require 'slime)
    (add-hook 'lisp-mode-hook (lambda () (slime-mode t)))

  Make sure your `inferior-lisp-program' is set to a compatible
  version of Lisp. For CMUCL we currently require a post-18e
  snapshot. If you use a non-CMUCL backend, you will need to customize
  the elisp variable `slime-backend' and possibly
  `slime-lisp-binary-extension' too.

  Use `M-x' slime to fire up and connect to an inferior Lisp.

  Open a lisp-mode file and do `C-h m' to see the mode description.

Licence.
----------------------------------------

  The Emacs Lisp code is licensed under the GNU GPL to fit in with Emacs.

  The CMUCL and SBCL code is placed in the public domain to fit in
  with CMUCL and SBCL.

  The OpenMCL code is LLGPLed, just like OpenMCL.
