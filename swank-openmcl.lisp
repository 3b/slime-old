;;;
;;; This is the beginning of a Slime backend for OpenMCL.  It has been
;;; tested only with OpenMCL version 0.14-030901 on Darwin --- I would
;;; be interested in hearing the results with other versions.
;;;
;;; Additionally, reporting the positions of warnings accurately requires
;;; a small patch to the OpenMCL file compiler, which may be found at:
;;;
;;;   http://www.jamesjb.com/slime/openmcl-warning-position.diff
;;;
;;; Things that work:
;;;
;;; * Evaluation of forms with C-M-x.
;;; * Compilation of defuns with C-c C-c.
;;; * File compilation with C-c C-k.
;;; * Basic debugger functionality, jumping to frames is not implemented yet.
;;; * Macroexpanding with C-c RET.
;;; * Disassembling the symbol at point with C-c M-d.
;;; * Describing symbol at point with C-c C-d.
;;; * Compiler warnings are trapped and sent to Emacs using the buffer
;;;   position of the offending top level form.
;;; * Symbol completion and apropos.
;;;
;;; Things that sort of work:
;;;
;;; * WHO-CALLS is implemented but is only able to return the file a
;;;   caller is defined in---source location information is not available.
;;;
;;; Things that aren't done yet:
;;;
;;; * Cross-referencing.
;;; * Due to unimplementation functionality the test suite does not
;;;   run correctly (it hangs upon entering the debugger).
