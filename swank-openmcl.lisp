;;;
;;; This is the beginning of a Slime backend for OpenMCL.  It has been
;;; tested only with OpenMCL version 0.14-030901 on Darwin --- I would
;;; be interested in hearing the results with other versions.
;;;
;;; Things that work:
;;;
;;; * Evaluation of forms with C-M-x.
;;; * Compilation of defuns with C-c C-c.
;;; * File compilation with C-c C-k.
;;; * Basic debugger functionality, jumping to frames is not implemented yet.
;;; * Macroexpanding with C-c RET.
;;; * Disassembling the symbol at point with C-c M-d.
;;; * Describing symbol at point with C-c C-d.
;;;
;;; Things that sort of work:
;;;
;;; * Compiler warnings are trapped and sent to Emacs.  The elisp code
;;;   attempts to place the warnings on the correct defun by doing
;;;   regular expression searches.  Does not work in all cases.
;;;
;;; Things that aren't done yet:
;;;
;;; * Cross-referencing.
;;; * Symbol completion.
;;; * Apropos.
;;; * Due to unimplementation functionality the test suite does not
;;;   run correctly (it hangs upon entering the debugger).
