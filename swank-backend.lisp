;;;; Compilation

(defgeneric compile-string-for-emacs (string &key buffer position)
  (:documentation
   "Compile source from STRING.  During compilation, compiler
conditions must be trapped and resignalled as COMPILER-CONDITIONs.

If supplied, BUFFER and POSITION specify the source location in Emacs.

Additionally, if POSITION is supplied, it must be added to source
positions reported in compiler conditions."))

(defgeneric compile-file-for-emacs (filename load-p)
  (:documentation
   "Compile FILENAME signalling COMPILE-CONDITIONs.
If LOAD-P is true, load the file after compilation."))


;;;; Documentation

(defgeneric arglist-string (function-name)
  (:documentation
   "Return the argument for FUNCTION-NAME as a string.
The result should begin and end with parenthesis."))

(defgeneric macroexpand-all (form)
  (:documentation
   "Recursively expand all macros in FORM.
Return the resulting form."))

(defgeneric describe-symbol-for-emacs (symbol)
  (:documentation
   "Return a property list describing SYMBOL.

The property list has an entry for each interesting aspect of the
symbol. The recognised keys are:

  :VARIABLE :FUNCTION :SETF :TYPE :CLASS :MACRO :COMPILER-MACRO
  :ALIEN-TYPE :ALIEN-STRUCT :ALIEN-UNION :ALIEN-ENUM

The value of each property is the corresponding documentation string,
or :NOT-DOCUMENTED. It is legal to include keys not listed here.

Properties should be included if and only if they are applicable to
the symbol. For example, only (and all) fbound symbols should include
the :FUNCTION property.

Example:
\(describe-symbol-for-emacs 'vector)
  => (:CLASS :NOT-DOCUMENTED
      :TYPE :NOT-DOCUMENTED
      :FUNCTION \"Constructs a simple-vector from the given objects.\")"))
