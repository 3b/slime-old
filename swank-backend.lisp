Properties should be included if and only if they are applicable to
the symbol. For example, only (and all) fbound symbols should include
the :FUNCTION property.

debug the debugger! Instead, such conditions can be reported to the
user without (re)entering the debugger by wrapping them as
`sldb-condition's."))

The result is a list:

condition-description---a string describing the condition that
triggered the debugger.

restart---a pair of strings: restart name, and description.

stack-frame---a number from zero (the top), and a printed
representation of the frame's call.

Below is an example return value. In this case the condition was a
division by zero (multi-line description), and only one frame is being
fetched (start=0, end=1).

START and END are zero-based indices constraining the number of
frames returned.  Frame zero is defined as the frame which invoked
the debugger.

The backtrace is returned as a list of tuples of the form
\(FRAME-NUMBER FRAME-DESCRIPTION), where FRAME-NUMBER is the
index of the frame, defined like START/END, and FRAME-DESCRIPTION
is a string containing text to display in the debugger for this
frame.
