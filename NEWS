* SLIME News                  -*- outline -*-

* 1.0 beta (August 2004)

** autodoc global variables
The slime-autodoc-mode will now automatically show the value of a
global variable at point.

** Customize group
The customize group is expanded and better-organised.

** slime-interactive-eval
Interactive-eval commands now print their results to the REPL when
given a prefix argument.

** slime-conservative-indentation
New Elisp variable. Non-nil means that we exclude def* and with-* from
indentation-learning. The default is t.

** (slime-setup)
New function to streamline setup in ~/.emacs

** Modeline package
The package name in the modeline is now updated on an idle timer. The
message should now be more meaningful when moving around in files
containing multiple IN-PACKAGE forms.

** XREF bugfix
The XREF commands did not find symbols in the right package.

** REPL prompt
The package name in the REPL's prompt is now abbreviated to the last
`.'-delimited token, e.g. MY.COMPANY.PACKAGE would be PACKAGE. This
can be disabled by setting SWANK::*AUTO-ABBREVIATE-DOTTED-PACKAGES* to
NIL.

** CMUCL source cache
The source cache is now populated on `first-change-hook'. This makes
M-. work accurately in more file modification scenarios.

** SBCL compiler errors
Detect compiler errors and make some noise. Previously certain
problems (e.g. reader-errors) could slip by quietly.

* 1.0 alpha (June 2004)

The first preview release of SLIME.
