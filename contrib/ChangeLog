	* slime-c-p-c.el (slime-c-p-c-unambiguous-prefix-p): New variable.

	Move asdf support to contrib:

	* slime-asdf.el: New file.

	* swank-asdf.lisp: New file
	(operate-on-system, asdf-central-registry)
	(list-all-systems-known-to-asdf): Use the asdf package in the
	source code, i.e. write asdf:operate instead of
	 (find-symbol "OPERATE" "ASDF").

2007-09-04  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	* slime-tramp.el: New file.
	* slime-banner.el: New file.

2007-09-01  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* slime-fancy.el: New meta-contrib.

2007-09-01  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* slime-presentations.el (slime-dispatch-presentation-event):
	Explicitly return t to indicate the events have been handled,
	rather than relying on the return values of the called functions.

2007-09-01  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* slime-typeout-frame.el (slime-typeout-autodoc-message): Fix for
	messages that contain "%".  Reported by Martin Simmons.

2007-09-01  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	Makes `slime-complete-form' work on `(eval-when |'; doesn't work
	on `(eval-when (|' yet.
	
	* slime-parse.el (slime-parse-sexp-at-point): Guard against
	`(char-after)' being NIL at end of buffer (especially important
	for use on the REPL.)

	* swank-arglist.lisp (arglist-dispatch 'eval-when): Fix typo.
	(print-decoded-arglist-as-template): Print keywords with PRIN1.
	
2007-08-31  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	Added extended arglist display for EVAL-WHEN, viz:

	  (eval-when (&any :compile-toplevel :load-toplevel :execute) &body body)

	Notice that completion works as expected on these keywords.

	Die, EVAL-ALWAYS, die!

	* swank-arglist (arglist-dispatch): New method for EVAL-WHEN.
	(print-arglist): Print keywords with PRIN1 rather than PRINC,
	to get a result as shown above for the EVAL-WHEN case.
	(completions-for-keyword): Add support for &ANY args.	 
	
2007-08-31  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-arglist.lisp: Do not fall back to READ when interpreting
	the ``raw form specs'' comming from Slime's autodoc stuff. But
	still do so for those comming from `slime-complete-form'.

	(unintern-in-home-package): New.

	(*arglist-dummy*): New.
	(read-conversatively-for-autodoc): New function. Doesn't READ
	anything that comes from Slime's autodoc. Just tries to parse
	symbols. If that's not successfull, returns the dummy placeholder
	datum stored in `*arglist-dummy*'.
	(arglist-for-echo-area): Parse form-specs using
	`read-conversatively-for-autodoc'. Use `unintern-in-home-package'.

	(read-softly): New. Splitted out from `read-form-spec'. This
	function tries to keep track of newly interned functions before
	READing.
	(read-form-spec): Parametrized to take a function to read the
	elements of the passed ``raw form spec''. Uses `read-softly' as
	default reader.

	(complete-form, completions-for-keywords): 
	Use `unintern-in-home-package'.

	* slime-editing-commands.el: Add installation notes.

	* slime-parse.el: New file.

	* slime-presentations.el (slime-last-output-target-id)
	(slime-output-target-to-marker, slime-output-target-marker)
	(slime-redirect-trace-output): Moved back into SLIME core.

	function. Add it to slime-repl-clear-buffer-hook.

2007-08-24  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	Some fixes to the presentation-streams contrib.
	
	* swank-presentation-streams.lisp [sbcl]: Load the pretty-printer
	patch only at load time.  Add some trickery so that SBCL does not
	complain about the changed layout of the pretty-stream class.
	
	* swank-presentation-streams.lisp (slime-stream-p): Using special
	return values, indicate whether we are printing to the
	REPL-results stream, or a dedicated stream.
	(presentation-record): New slot "target".
	(presentation-start, presentation-end): Use it (rather than the
	global variable *use-dedicated-output-stream*) to decide whether
	to use the bridge protocol or the :presentation-start/-end
	protocol.  Also use it as the TARGET argument of
	:presentation-start/-end messages. 
	(presenting-object-1): Use the new return values of
	slime-stream-p.
	
	* swank-presentation-streams.lisp (slime-stream-p) [cmu]: Use the
	return value of slime-stream-p rather than the global variable
	*use-dedicated-output-stream* to decide whether printing through
	pretty streams is safe for the layout.

2007-08-24  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	Make the fancy "presentation streams" feature a contrib.
	Previously, it was only available if "present.lisp" was loaded
	manually. 
	
	* slime-presentation-streams.el: New file.

	* swank-fancy-inspector.lisp: New file. The only difference to the

	specialized to the new class `fancy-inspector'.
	(fancy-inspector): New class.

	* slime-fancy-inspector.el: New file.

2007-08-19  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	completion.
