slime-filename-translations which uses Tramp to load files on
hostname using username. MACHINE-INSTANCE is a required
parameter, REMOTE-HOST defaults to MACHINE-INSTANCE and USERNAME
defaults to (user-login-name).

MACHINE-INSTANCE is the value returned by slime-machine-instance,
which is just the value returned by cl:machine-instance on the
remote lisp. REMOTE-HOST is the fully qualified domain name (or
just the IP) of the remote machine. USERNAME is the username we
should login with.
The functions created here expect your tramp-default-method or
 tramp-default-method-alist to be setup correctly."
