;;; Commentary

;; This minor mode extends Lisp-Mode with CMUCL-specific features.
;; The features can be summarised thusly:
;;
;;   Separate control channel for communication with CMUCL, similar to
;;   Hemlock. This is used to implement other features, rather than
;;   talking to the Lisp listener "in-band".
;;
;;   Compiler notes and warnings are visually annotated in the source
;;   buffer. Commands are provided for inspecting and navigating
;;   between notes.
;;
;;   Comforts familiar from ILISP and Emacs Lisp: completion of
;;   symbols, automatic display of arglists in function calls,
;;   TAGS-like definition finding, Lisp evaluation, online
;;   documentation, etc.
;;
;;   Common Lisp debugger interface.
;;
;; The goal is to make Emacs support CMU Common Lisp as well as it
;; supports Emacs Lisp. The strategy is to take maximum advantage of
;; all CMUCL features and hooks, portability be damned to hades.
;;
;; Compatibility with other Common Lisps is not an immediate
;; goal. SBCL support would be highly desirable in the future.
;;
;; SLIME is compatible with GNU Emacs 20 and 21, and XEmacs 21.
;; Development copies may have temporary have portability bugs.

;;; Evaluation mechanics

;; The SLIME protocol is implemented with a small state machine. That
;; means the program uses "state" data structures to remember where
;; it's up to -- whether it's idle, or waiting for an evaluation
;; request from Lisp, whether it's debugging, and so on.
;;
;; The state machine has a stack for putting states that are only
;; partially complete, i.e. it is a "push-down automaton" like they
;; use in parsers. This design works well because the SLIME protocol
;; can be described as a context-free grammar, loosely:
;;
;;   CONVERSATION ::= <EXCHANGE>*
;;   EXCHANGE     ::= request reply
;;                or  request <DEBUG> reply
;;   DEBUG        ::= enter-debugger <CONVERSATION> debug-return
;;
;; Or, in plain english, in the simplest case Emacs asks Lisp to
;; evaluate something and Lisp sends the result. But it's also
;; possible that Lisp signals a condition and enters the debugger
;; while computing the reply. In that case both sides enter a
;; debugging state, and can have arbitrary nested conversations until
;; a restart makes the debugger return.
;;
;; The state machine's stack represents the interesting parts of the
;; remote Lisp stack. Each Emacs state on the stack corresponds to a
;; particular Lisp stack frame. When that frame returns it sends a
;; message to Emacs delivering a result, which Emacs delivers to the
;; state and pops its stack. So the stacks are kept synchronized.
;;
;; The format of events is lists whose CAR is a symbol identifying the
;; type of event and whose CDR contains any extra arguments. We treat
;; events created by Emacs the same as events sent by Lisp, but by
;; convention use "emacs-" as a prefix on the names of events
;; originating locally in Emacs.
;;
;; There are also certain "out of band" messages which are handled by
;; a special function instead of reaching the state machine.
